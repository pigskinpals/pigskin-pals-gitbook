# üê∑ Season One: The Oinks

In Season One, we follow the first group to enter the atmosphere of Planet Football: The Oinks. Don‚Äôt let their cute and cuddly appearances fool you. They can pack a punch and are known for their prowess on the defensive side of gridiron. Their signature move, the Pork Chop, can tear through an O-Line like a hot knife through butter. They come from their home planet, the Muddership, a warm tropical planet in the heart of the Swine Nebula.

In the year 2022, a battalion of 9,600 of the toughest Oinks set out on a mission to the Arachne Galaxy in order to sign a pivotal peace treaty between their race and the Arachnids, a species of spider-like humanoids known to be aggressive warmongers. Ever since Charlotte, the Arachnid‚Äôs peaceful Queen Mother died, multiple rebellious factions hungry for power have launched attacks on neighboring systems including the home planet of the Oinks. The Oinks‚Äô battalion was charged with delivering a peace offering of gold to one of the rebel factions on an outskirt planet in the Arachne galaxy where a rebel Arachnid base was located. During the journey, their ship‚Äôs geolocator was damaged causing the battalion to fall into a time/space limbo  Their ship tumbled through this limbo for what felt like minutes and crash landed on a previously civilized but seemingly abandoned planet. Planet Football.

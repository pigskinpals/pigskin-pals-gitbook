# üí∞ Prize Pool & Philanthropy

Our prize pool will be set based on the success of the mint of our project. Our mission is to give a significant amount of the mint revenue back to the community of Pigskin Pal holders as well as the broader community at large.&#x20;

**üíµ  Our target prize pool for the 2022-2023 season is 25% of Mint Revenue.**&#x20;

**üèà  Our target philanthropy pool for the 2022-2023 season is 15% of Mint Revenue.**

The remaining **60%** will be used to invest back into Pigskin Pals to grow the brand as well as to pay for operating expenses.&#x20;

### How to Win in Season One!

**In Season One, each week (18 total), the top 5 scores for the six fantasy football positions (QB, RB, WR, TE, K, D/ST) will receive a payout in ETH to their NFT holding wallet on Tuesday mornings at 9 am.**

For the innaugural season of Pigskin Pals, our team's mission was to release a stellar artistic collection of 9,600 NFTs and create the foundational backend technology (smart contract, website,  mobile app, etc.) to build our game. Not to mention, the time spent in marketing our vision to customers like yourself. Our hope with season one was to get people used to the idea of power-ups and multipliers. Therefore, season one will only reward the top 5 individual NFT scores per position per week.

_**Note:** If you do the math, your chances of winning are slim, yes. We know that. And yes, there isn't much you can do in season one to increase and/or decreases your chances of winning outside of buying more NFTs and hoping for the best._&#x20;

_Your chance of winning prize money is 5/1600 or .3% every week. Yes, that is a very low %. However, our mission is to build a new strategic game of fantasy football that you can play forever. Our mission is not to just give away free money (outside of our philanthropy). You could own these NFTs forever, and in theory, you can play our game forever. Our mission is to continue building our brand and expanding our game, bringing in new members into our community. We aren't promising a 10x on your investment or any asymetric upside to take advantage of in our game. What we do promise is a damn good game._

### Commitment to Philanthropy

I am a firm believer that creating decentralized communities through web3 has the potential to do so much good for a community around you

# ðŸ—º Roadmap

### June 2022: Pigskin Pals Mobile Launch!

Our mobile app will allow you to connect your wallet and register for our OG list and/or Whitelist. The full gameplay will be added to the app with an update in August.

### Late July/Early August 2022: Minting Available!

The exact date of the mint is TBA. On that day, Pigskin Pal NFTs will be available first to OGs to purchase, then to Whitelist, then to the Public.

### August 2022: Gameplay Launch!

Our team has been working day and night behind the scenes to deliver an exceptional mobile game experience. We are excited to launch the Pigskin Pals game and get all of your feedback on how we can create a truly amazing fantasy football experience.

### September 2022 - Summer 2023

#### Focus Area 1 . Game Maintenance

From the start of the season, we will be working tirelessly to make sure all the players have a bug-free experience. This can be anything from connect wallet issues to scoring errors to payout issues. We know that things will break. That's just the nature of creating something brand new. We can't control that, but we can control our reactions to these issues. Our focus is on making sure the foundational technology of our game is sound before we can build on top of it.

**Focus Area 2. Head**-**to-Head Matches!**

Head to Head Matches is the target and our team will be working on building out the gameplay in the app. We plan on having the technology ready before the season is over so that we can conduct system testing prior to the official launch of head-to-head matches next season (2023-2024).

**Focus Area 3. Season Two Collection.**

Will the Arachnids join the Planet Football story or will a new alien species come into the fray? You as a Pigskin Pal owner can vote on how you want the story to continue. This is an interactive and creative space where we allow the community to drive the storyline and adventures that happen on Planet Football.

**Focus Area 4. Community, Philanthropy, and Merchandise**

Throughout this experience, we will work to enhance our discord infrastructure and roles, host side-events and games, and generally keep our devoted community members entertained. We want this experience to be a meaningful one. Additionally, our leadership team is focused on distributing our time and money into the community through IRL volunteering events, donations for special projects (playgrounds, basketball courts, etc.)

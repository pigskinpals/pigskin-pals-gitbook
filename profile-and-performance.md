# ðŸ“ˆ Profile and Performance

After connecting your wallet, your profile page will show you your ETH balance in your wallet. Additionally, we added a C/P button that will allow you to quickly utilize your wallet address from our app. By clicking on the "Performance" card, you can view in depth score coverage from each of the Pigskin Pals that you own on a weekly basis. This score is updated every 5 minutes via an ESPN fantasy football score API built in our backend. You can further access the details of each individual player's scores by clicking the player's card. We have also added a search bar for the Pigskin Pals fanatics who may own many Pigskin Pals :).

**Figure C:** On this screen, you will be able to see your pigskin pals and scroll through them. They will updated automatically as they will always directly reflect the contents of your wallet.

**Figure D:** On this screen, you will be able to see the averages for your pigs. They will automatically sort alphabetically by team and position order (QB, RB, WR, TE, K, D/ST). This is the MVP season 1 mockup, but we plan on releasing more fantasy analytics tied to your NFTs.
